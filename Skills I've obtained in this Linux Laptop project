ðŸ”§ What I Did

Installed Linux (likely Xubuntu or similar lightweight distro) on a 2012 HP laptop.

Created bootable USB using Termux on Android (no other computer available).

Partitioned drive manually:

/dev/sda1 as EFI

/dev/sda2 as root /

/dev/sda3 as swap


Fixed WiFi issues by compiling Realtek RTL8723DE driver manually in Termux and transferring it.

Used XFCE terminal and CLI tools to configure the system without a GUI-based installer.

Set up connectivity via mobile hotspot after no network manager was showing.

Partitioning and formatting

Networking troubleshooting

Driver installation (manual kernel module build)

Patience, hustle, and a whole lotta of brainpower


 Future Plans

Add Brave browser or Chromium

Turn system into a coding/dev machine
